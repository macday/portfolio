            I am a second year undergraduate student at
            <a href="https://www.ryerson.ca/" target="_blank">
              Ryerson University
            </a>
            in the core of downtown Toronto. Computer Science is the field in
            which I study and I quite enjoy it - even though it can get very
            tedious sometimes (opcode, pointers, etc). I've actually been
            programming for nearly 5 years now (yes, since high school). I
            started at around age 14 or 15 in grade 10 when I took ICS and
            started learning Java. <br /><br />
            <a href="https://schoolweb.tdsb.on.ca/ufa/" target="_blank">
              Ursula Franklin Academy
            </a>
            is the high-school I attended. I had an amazing grade 10 teacher who
            encouraged me to continue studying computer science. From there, I
            went onto learning ICS in grades 11 and 12 where I found another great
            teacher. She supported me throughout my studies - specifically in
            Math and Computer Science - and was also just an amazing person to
            talk to for advice.

            My current workplace. I've been working here since July of 2019 and
            love it! I am an IT Support Technician and essentially look after
            everything technical at the Toronto office. With over 100 employees
            based in just Toronto, you can imagine the amount of issues that
            arise. I'm kept quite busy in the office; when I'm in, there is
            always something new to do - that's one of the many reasons I love
            working here!

            I've been an in-home tutor since the start of March 2019. I
            primarily cover math, but am capable of tutoring in chemistry and
            physics. All studies are done at a high school level from grades 9 -
            12. To find a more detailed description of my work history, check

            I became interested in computers and programming back in grade 10. Since then I've built my own custom PC that has been through two upgrades. I've taken up learning Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems as they each have their own great features.
            <br><br>
            Stepping aside from computers for a minute. I grew up playing competitive hockey on the Toronto Eagles; I was also captain on my team for my final two seasons. I've always been a very active person, just recently I've taken up snowboarding in the winter months, rock climbing & bouldering, and going to some spin classes at <a href="https://ridecycleclub.com/">Ride Cycle Club</a>.
