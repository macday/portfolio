            Hi there! It seems you have stumbled onto my webpage. While you're
            here, why don't you take a look around? I'd really appreciate it! There are a few goodies I've
            got here.
            <br><br>
            If you're thinking "wow! this guy's pretty cool! I gotta get in
            touch with him!" then you gotta head over to the
            <a href="">About Me</a> page. You can find everything you'll need to
            contact me there!

          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I am a computer enthusiast. I've a <strong>HUGE</strong> interest in every technology! Hardware, software, networking, machine learning, artificial intelligence, you name it! I developed this website overnight on my custom built PC which you can find the specs for <a href="">here</a>!
            <br><br>
            Currently, my main goal is focusing on my <a href="">education</a> and finding a co-op position for the Summer work term that's coming up.

          <p>
            I am a second year undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.ryerson.ca/">Ryerson University</a> in the core of downtown Toronto. Computer Science is the field in which I study and I quite enjoy it - even though it can get very tedious sometimes (opcode, pointers, etc). I've actually been programming for nearly 5 years now (yes, since high school). I started at around age 14 or 15 in grade 10 when I took ICS and started learning Java.
            <br><br>
            <a href="https://schoolweb.tdsb.on.ca/ufa/">Ursula Franklin Academy</a> is the high-school I attended. I had an amazing grade 10 teacher who encouraged me to pursue a degree in computer science. From there, I continued with ICS in grades 11 and 12 where I found another great teacher. She supported me throughout my studies - specifically in Math and Computer Science - and was also just an amazing person to talk to (great advice giver!).

            My current workplace. I've been working here since July of 2019 and love it! I am an IT Support Technician and essentially look after everything technical at the Toronto office. With over 100 employees based in just Toronto, you can imagine the amount of issues that arise. I'm kept quite busy in the office, when I'm in there is always something new to do - that's one of the many reasons I love working here!
